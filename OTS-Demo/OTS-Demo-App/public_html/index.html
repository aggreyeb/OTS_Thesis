                   I am a researcher from Athabasca University, Alberta, Canada. I am completing the research in partial fulfillment of Master of Science in Information Systems, under supervision of Dr. Maiga Chang. I am conducting a study to determine users' perceptions of the usability of an Online Test System (OTS) so that the implemented higher order cognitive item generation mechanism (embedded online test system) can be improved in the future. We will appreciate if you could kindly watch all the demo videos and fill the questionnaire.

                  <p style="text-align: justify">
                     Higher Cognitive Level Assessment (HCLA) is an integral part of learning in many domains such as education, pharmacy. For teachers HCLA provides a means to measure student's ability to apply concepts, analyze data or situation as well as designing, constructing and generating new ideas. In the case of students, it is a way to get feedback on their learning and to improving on their performance.
                  </p> 
                  <p style="text-align: justify">
                      Perhaps the most widely use HCLA tool is multiple-choice based test or examination because it is easy to score and makes it ideal choice in large classes . However, it takes considerable amount of time and effort for teachers to construct multiple choice test questions.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p style="text-align: justify">
                      In an effort to make construction of higher cognitive questions less labour intensive and reliable, many researchers in literature have used different techniques (e.g. Natural Language Processing-based to develop automatic item generation (AIG) systems. However, most of these systems lack the ability to generate higher cognitive multiple-choice questions to test students' cognitive abilities.
                  </p>
                   <p style="text-align: justify">
                      The goal of this study is to design and implement test item generation engine for an Online Test System (OTS). The proposed system will be valuable tool for teachers, as it will allow them to assess students beyond memorizing and recalling facts. Moreover, it will allow students to exercise their application, analytical and critical thinking skills. Furthermore, it will go a long way to cut down the time the time teachers spend on creating multiple-choice questions.

                 <h4>Follow-Up Pages</h4>
                  <p style="text-align: justify">
                   There are 9 videos to introduce the features of OTS. The first video(2 minutes:06seconds) will introduce the users of the systems, followed by how teachers can request for an account (55 seconds).  Then other videos which includes Manage Courses (35 seconds) will show how to create courses, Manage Knowledge Maps (3 minutes:46 seconds ) will demonstrate how to manage knowledge maps, and how to associate Knowledge Map to Course (1 minutes:7 seconds). In addition, manage Course Test (1 minutes:18 seconds) will demonstrate the process managing course Test (2 minutes). Next,the process of generating Higher and Lower Cognitive  test will be shown in generate test items video (3 minutes:52 seconds) followed by how to activate a test(36 seconds) for students to take the test. Finally, the last video (1 minutes:17 seconds) will provide link to Online Test System Web site to try the system and also a link to a questionnaire.
